        <h1>What are dogs being treated in our country?</h1>
        <p>
            In our country, everyday we see so many dogs. Some pet dogs and some stray dogs. But how many of these
            dogs are treated with care and condition. Every now and then, we hear about incidents in which dogs are
            being hurt or even killed. This is very terrible. We Care For Dogs wishes to bring a change in this 
            area.

        <h1>What we do?</h1>
        <p>
            At We Care For Dogs, we look after dogs that do not have a home. We help these dogs to find a home. Not
            only that we also feed stray dogs and make sure they are not being hurt by anyone. This organization 
            was started 5 years ago and since then we are working towards our mission everyday. But we cannot do
            this alone we need your support.
        </p>
